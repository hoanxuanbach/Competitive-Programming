# Competitive-Programming

This Github repository contains all OI and ICPC problems I've worked so far. I solved most of them on my own, but for a few, I checked out other solutions to help me understand the ideas better. So you might notice that some of the code looks similar to other solutions out there. If anyone feels that my code resembles their work and would prefer I not use it, please feel free to contact me.

After I finish pushing all my works on this repo, I might write some editorials for JOI problems in the near future. When I was solving them, I found it pretty tough to translate and understand the Japanese editorials, so I think having English versions could really help others. 

My English isn't very strong, so if you notice any mistakes or anything confusing, please help me improve those editorials.
